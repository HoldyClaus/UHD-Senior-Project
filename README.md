## How it Works

## WireFrame
![original-project-outline]

Our original wireframe includes a header, aside, and body section.
For this Project we will be using these three main front end languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- HTML - this is the markup language for our document to be displayed on the web browser
- CSS - this is the language we use to style an HTML document as well as describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
- JavaScript - this  is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else

## Latest Development Changes
```
git clone https://github.com/HoldyClaus/UHD-Senior-Project.git
```

## Future Features
With this project we would like to expand our scope beyond the search engine and push the bounds like amazon and compete with them!

These are some of our purposed additions:
- Text to speech function with an API call so that the either words, defenitions, letters or numbers will be read out to the user.
- Expand our scope of being able to set up more customizable so that the users can save to their profile.
- Users have the ability to set up a store for themselves on the webpage.
- More comprehensive deep searching algorithm to help find better results for the customer.
